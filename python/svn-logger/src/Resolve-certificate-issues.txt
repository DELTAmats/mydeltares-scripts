The certificate for oss.deltares.nl is valid, but it is missing a chain certificate as shown in the report by ssllabs:

Chain issues    Incomplete
....
2   Extra download  Thawte DV SSL CA
Fingerprint:  beb8efe9b1a73c841b375a90e5fff8048848e3a2af66f6c4dd7b938d6fe8c5d8

The "Incomplete" and "Extra download" are the major points. Some browsers will have the missing chain certificate cached,
others will do the download and other will fail.

Download the missing chain certificates and use it as trusted CA certificate with the verify parameter for requests.
Don't just disable validation because then you are open to man-in-the-middle attacks.

Step by step instruction:

    Download the missing certificate chain using download button from the report by ssllabs

    Modify your call to
    requests.get('https://oss.deltares.nl', verify = 'oss.deltares.nl-chain.pem')
